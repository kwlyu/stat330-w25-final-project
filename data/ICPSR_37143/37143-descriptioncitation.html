		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>The current collection includes data collected as part of a planned evaluation of New York City's proposed soda portion cap policy. Baseline data collection was conducted in three waves. Wave 1 began in early January 2013 and ended in April 2013; Wave 2 was conducted from August to November 2013; and Wave 3 was conducted between January and June 2014.</p>
<p>Data was collected at point-of-purchase on the availability, sizing, promotion, and cost of beverages in the fast food restaurants of New York City, New York and of Newark and Jersey City in New Jersey. This data was also collected in these areas for their nearest convenience stores/bodegas and supermarkets. Consumer receipts were also gathered to supplement this survey data. Additional data collection was conducted using environmental scans of fast food and grocery store locations to evaluate the healthfulness of the beverage environment. Lastly, some participants also completed a telephone interview where data was gathered on participant's dietary recall.</p>
<p>These data are intended to gather a fuller picture of the factors that may influence beverage purchases. </p></span></p>

								<div><strong>Time Period(s):</strong> <p>2013 -- 2014</p></div>
								<div><strong>Date of Collection:</strong> <p>2013-01 -- 2013-04 (Wave 1), 2013-08 -- 2013-11 (Wave 2), 2014-01 -- 2014-06 (Wave 3)</p></div>
								<div><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> <p><p>Data from the point-of-purchase survey dataset, point-of-purchase receipt dataset, and the dietary recall dataset can be merged utilizing the receipt identifier variable, RECEIPTID. The data can also be merged with the environmental scan datasets by utilizing the NEMS location variable, NEMSLOCATIONINDICATOR.</p> <p>The point-of-purchase and dietary recall datasets need to be merged first before merging them to store environmental scans as those datasets do not have the NEMS location variable needed to merge to store-level datasets.</p></p></div>
		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> This data was collected as part of a planned evaluation of New York City's proposed soda portion policy (Sugary Drinks Portion Cap Rule).</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> <p>Baseline data collection for this study was conducted in three waves: Wave 1 began in early January 2013 and ended in April 2013; Wave 2 was conducted from August to November 2013; and Wave 3 was conducted between January and June 2014.</p>
<p> For the first wave, data collectors stood outside identified fast food venues and recruited costumers to participate in the survey and collected their receipts (receipts for gift cards, happy meal toys, or other non-food items did not qualify for participation). Interviewers visited each location for three hours during lunch and dinner times. Data from this wave is contained in datasets one (survey data) and two (receipt data).</p>
<p>For the second wave, researchers visited 40 restaurants, convenience stores, and supermarkets to conduct environmental scans (some stores and restaurants were visited multiple times to evaluate inter-rater reliability). Scans were completed using a version of the Nutrition Environment Measures Survey (NEMS) environmental scan, created to assess the retail environment specific to beverages (NEMS-B). The NEMS data is contained in datasets three (fast food and convenience store NEMS data) and four (grocery store NEMS data) </p>
<p>For the third wave, 1,000 participants from the original point-of-purchase survey who volunteered to continue, participated in phone interviews regarding dietary recall. Data were collected using a free, online multi-pass dietary recall program developed by the National Cancer Institute, called ASA24: Automated Self-administered 24-hour Recall. This data is found in dataset five (dietary recall data) </p></span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> <p>Newark and Jersey City were selected as comparison cities for New York City through a method that assessed the degree of similarity between observations (in this case, cities) with regard to a set of demographic characteristics.</p>
<p>The five restaurant chains with the largest presence in New York City and Newark (Burger King, KFC, McDonald's, Subway, and Wendy's) were studied in each data collection period.</p>
<p>Neighborhoods of New York City, Jersey City, and Newark with restaurants of the selected chains were matched based on population size, age, race/ethnicity, poverty level, obesity rate, and diabetes rate. Within these neighborhoods restaurant locations were matched by chain name and key structural and geographic characteristics that might affect customer mix, such as nearby public transportation stations and housing complexes. The sample included a disproportionate number of restaurant locations in low-income, high-minority neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Data collectors then approached all customers at the selected fast-food restaurants who appeared to be eighteen years or older as they entered. Customers were told that they could receive $2 for answering a few questions and providing their register receipt following their visit. Restaurants were surveyed during lunch and dinner hours.</p></span></p>
